Hi! I'm currently a research intern at <a href="https://vision.snu.ac.kr/" style="color: #7289da; text-decoration:none">**Vision & Learning Lab**</a>, under the supervision of Prof. <a href="https://vision.snu.ac.kr/gunhee/" style="color: #7289da; text-decoration:none">**Gunhee Kim**</a>.

My research interest lies in improving neural networks in more realistic learning scenarios, like non-stationary environments and setups with limited training data.

I'm particularly interested in:

-   Meta-learning
-   Continual learning
-   Reinforcement learning

## Education

-   **B.S.** in <span style="color:darkred">Statistics</span> and <span style="color:darkred">Artificial Intelligence</span>, <a href="https://en.snu.ac.kr/" style="color: #7289da; text-decoration: none;">**Seoul National University**</a> \\
    Mar. 2017 - Aug. 2023 (Leave of absence for military service: Mar. 2019 - Oct. 2020) \\
    Graduated with <span style="color:darkred">**Summa Cum Laude**</span> (GPA: 3.95 / 4.3)
    
## Ongoing Projects

-   **A Survey on the Intersection of Continual Learning and Meta-Learning** \\
    Providing a reliable taxonomy and review on meta-continual learning & continual meta-learning to distinguish them

-   **Reformulating Meta-Continual Learning as a Sequence Modeling Problem** \\
    Establishing a connection between two significant bodies of machine learning research: continual learning & sequence modeling
    Under Review

## Work Experience

-   Knowledge AI Lab, <a href="https://kr.ncsoft.com/en/" style="color: #7289da; text-decoration: none;">**NCSOFT**</a> \\
    Jul 2021 - Aug 2021 \\
    Research Intern

## Honors

-   Songam Scholarship \\
    Mar. 2017 - Feb. 2023
