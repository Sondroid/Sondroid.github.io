Hi! I'm currently a research intern at <a href="https://vision.snu.ac.kr/" style="color: #7289da; text-decoration:none">**Vision & Learning Lab**</a>, under the supervision of Prof. <a href="https://vision.snu.ac.kr/gunhee/" style="color: #7289da; text-decoration:none">**Gunhee Kim**</a>.

My research interest primarily lies in:

-   Transfer learning: to extract meta-knowledge to build foundational model. This includes meta-learning, pre-trained LM, and offline RL.
-   Improving neural networks in more realistic learning scenarios, especially under non-stationarity and resource constraint.

I'm looking forward to attending NeurIPS 2023 in New Orleans this December! I'll deliver a poster presentation for my 2nd-author paper.
